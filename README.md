# Gemini 
## AI scripts

##### About
These are entirly created with AI. I have been using Gemini to assist me with a rasperry pi pico w2 build attached to a common anode rgb led, a lcd1602 display, and a joystick module via a breadboard and jumper wires. It is majorly composed of MycroPython. 

##### Layout
There is a main.py that runs when the pico is powered on. The lcd display lib took several iteraations to find one that worked.
